# Now for AIâ€™s Latest Trick: Writing Computer Code

The above headline is from an [article](https://www.wired.com/story/ai-latest-trick-writing-computer-code/) on Wired, which made me question the roles of software engineers in the future.

SourceAi, a Paris-based startup is fine-tuning a tool that uses artificial intelligence to write code based on a short text description of what the code should do. Advances in machine learning have made it possible to automate an increasing number of coding tasks, such as auto-completing segments of code and fine-tuning algorithms. This made me ponder whether the roles of programmers are going to be obsolete in the future.

After some research, I accept that the role of programmers may only change as AI systems further improve. Rather than writing the actual code, the programmers will be responsible for analyzing and curating data for use as inputs to AI algorithms that will then create software. I believe that such a trend is inevitable, and so instead of fearing it, we -the programmers- must enhance our skill sets to adapt to the changing landscape.

The article found by Sashank made for an interesting read, and raises an important question - what shall be the role of programmers in the future with the improvement in Artificial Intelligence and its application to writing code. And, though, Sashank seems to suggest that Artifical Intelligence shall grow sufficiently powerful so as to relegate programmers to the role of an overseer, as much should be very down the line, at least in my opinion. Instead, I find the article to be suggesting that Artificial Intelligence has the potential to be a valuable aid, and remove some of the banality in programming whereby the programmer knows what he must do for a small task, but finds it irksome and boring to do as much.
